## Introduction

A new **Global AI Infrastructure Market Outlook to 2030** finds that AI infrastructure has moved beyond its experimental phase and is now entering an industrial-scale deployment cycle. What began as a race to train large models is evolving into a sustained, inference-led operating environment where cost efficiency, uptime, and energy availability increasingly determine success. As AI applications are embedded into core enterprise workflows, infrastructure decisions are becoming tightly linked to competitiveness, scalability, and long-term enterprise value.

The timing of this outlook is significant. Enterprises, hyperscalers, and governments are simultaneously accelerating AI deployment while confronting physical constraints that capital alone cannot solve. Power availability, cooling density, grid connection timelines, and semiconductor supply concentration are now shaping where AI capacity can be built and how quickly it can scale. These constraints are redefining infrastructure strategy from a technical function into a board-level concern.

## Key Findings

- The global AI infrastructure market is projected to grow from **US$87.6–182 billion in 2025 to US$197.6–499 billion by 2030**, depending on scope definition, significantly outpacing broader IT market growth.  
- Hardware accounts for approximately **61 percent of total market value**, while software and orchestration layers represent **24 percent** and are among the fastest-growing segments.  
- **98 percent of enterprises have adopted hybrid AI infrastructure**, establishing hybrid as the default deployment architecture rather than an optimization strategy.  
- Enterprise AI project abandonment has risen to **42 percent in 2025**, driven by cost overruns, idle compute capacity, and weak linkage between infrastructure spend and business value.  
- **79 percent of executives cite power availability as a primary constraint**, making energy access the most binding factor in near-term AI infrastructure expansion.

## Market Overview  

The **global AI infrastructure market outlook** points to sustained expansion through the end of the decade, but with growth increasingly governed by physical and operational constraints rather than demand or capital availability.

- Market size range (2025): **US$87.6–182 billion**  
- Market size range (2030): **US$197.6–499 billion**  
- Forecast growth rate: **17.7–29.1 percent compound annual growth**  

The market spans a vertically layered ecosystem including compute accelerators, high-performance networking and memory, power and cooling infrastructure, and orchestration software. Hardware continues to absorb the majority of near-term capital expenditure, but software platforms that improve utilization, workload placement, and cost control are becoming central to value realization as inference workloads scale.

The competitive environment remains highly concentrated at the accelerator layer, while becoming more fragmented across cloud, hybrid, and specialized infrastructure providers. Enterprises increasingly balance workloads across on-premises, cloud, and edge environments to manage cost, performance, latency, and regulatory exposure.

“AI infrastructure growth is no longer constrained by demand or investment appetite,” said **[Alora Advisory](/contact)**. “As inference workloads scale, power availability, utilization efficiency, and hybrid orchestration are emerging as the decisive factors that determine whether organizations can deploy AI sustainably at scale.”

For enterprise buyers, cloud providers, and investors, the outlook indicates a clear shift in value creation. Power-first planning, multi-vendor sourcing strategies, and software-driven optimization are becoming prerequisites rather than differentiators. At the same time, organizational readiness and workflow redesign are proving as critical as technology selection in achieving durable returns on AI infrastructure investments.
