## Market Definition

The global wearable medical devices market for chronic disease management refers to medical-grade, connected devices used for continuous monitoring and long-term management of chronic conditions. Growth is driven by rising disease prevalence, technological improvements in sensors and analytics, and the shift toward home-based and remote care models.

## Market Overview

Wearable medical devices were initially designed as diagnostic tools, particularly for glucose and cardiac rhythm monitoring. Over the past decade, advances in biosensors, battery efficiency, wireless connectivity, and software platforms have repositioned these devices as continuous disease management systems. The COVID-19 pandemic further accelerated clinical acceptance of remote patient monitoring and reinforced the shift away from hospital-centric care models.

Chronic diseases now account for more than 70% of global healthcare expenditure, creating sustained demand for scalable monitoring solutions that support early intervention, adherence, and outcome tracking. This structural context underpins the long-term relevance of the global wearable medical devices market for chronic disease management.
