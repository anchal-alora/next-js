## Introduction

A new **India Generative AI market outlook to 2030** indicates that Generative AI adoption in India is shifting from isolated experimentation toward structured enterprise and public-sector deployment. During the 2023–2024 period, improvements in foundation model performance, expanding cloud infrastructure availability, and greater institutional clarity around digital public infrastructure frameworks enabled organizations to move beyond proof-of-concept initiatives.

As of 2024, the India Generative AI market is estimated to be valued in the low-to-mid single-digit US$ billions. Over the medium term, the market is expected to expand at a high double-digit compound annual growth rate through 2030, driven primarily by enterprise productivity use cases, vertical-specific applications, and AI-enabled service exports.

## Market Overview

The **India Generative AI market outlook** points to a period of accelerated but uneven scaling through 2030. India’s position as a global IT services hub, combined with a large digital-native workforce, an active startup ecosystem, and national digital platforms such as Aadhaar, UPI, and ONDC, has created supportive structural conditions for Generative AI adoption.

Key growth drivers include enterprise productivity requirements, talent augmentation needs in knowledge-intensive functions, and ongoing public-sector digitalization initiatives. At the same time, adoption remains sensitive to macroeconomic conditions, global technology spending cycles, and infrastructure constraints. Energy availability and data center capacity are emerging as longer-term considerations for compute-intensive AI workloads.

By technology, large language models currently account for the largest share of deployments, while multimodal and domain-specific models are gaining traction in selected sectors. By end user, IT and IT-enabled services firms lead adoption, acting both as users and suppliers of Generative AI capabilities. Regionally, activity remains concentrated in South and West India, with other regions at earlier stages of market development.
