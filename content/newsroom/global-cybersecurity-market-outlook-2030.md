## Introduction

A new **global cybersecurity market outlook to 2030** finds that cybersecurity has moved from a reactive information technology function to a strategic priority for enterprises, governments, and critical infrastructure operators. The market is estimated at **US$215.0–225.0 billion in 2024** and is projected to reach **US$430.0–460.0 billion by 2030**, expanding at a **12–13 percent compound annual growth rate** during the forecast period.

The timing of this outlook is significant. Organizations are operating in an environment of expanding digital attack surfaces driven by cloud adoption, remote and hybrid work models, artificial intelligence deployment, and the convergence of information technology and operational technology systems. At the same time, regulatory frameworks governing data protection and critical infrastructure security are reinforcing minimum cybersecurity investment levels across regions.

## Market Overview  

The **global cybersecurity market outlook** points to a period of sustained, structurally driven growth rather than cyclical expansion. Cybersecurity spending has demonstrated relative resilience compared with broader information technology budgets, as cyber risk is increasingly treated as a material operational and financial exposure rather than a discretionary cost.

Market evolution is being shaped by a shift away from point-based tools toward integrated security platforms that combine cloud security, zero-trust architectures, identity-centric controls, and artificial intelligence–enabled threat detection. These changes reflect growing complexity in enterprise environments and the need for centralized visibility and automated response.

The full **[Global Cybersecurity Market Outlook to 2030](/insights/global-cybersecurity-market-outlook-2030)** outlines how these structural shifts are influencing security architectures and vendor strategies across regions and industries.
