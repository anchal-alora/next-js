## Introduction

A new **India AI Infrastructure Market Outlook to 2030** finds that the country’s AI infrastructure ecosystem is entering a structurally important phase. As artificial intelligence adoption expands from pilots to scaled deployment across enterprises, government institutions, and digital platforms, infrastructure has emerged as the binding constraint shaping outcomes. AI infrastructure in India now encompasses data centers, cloud infrastructure platforms such as Infrastructure-as-a-Service and Platform-as-a-Service, high-performance compute resources, networking and interconnection, power and cooling systems, and the platforms required to train, deploy, and operate AI models at scale.

The timing of this outlook is critical. India’s digital infrastructure base, historically built to support consumer internet usage and conventional enterprise IT workloads, is being stretched by AI-driven applications that are far more compute-dense, power-intensive, and network-sensitive. As a result, infrastructure strategy is shifting from demand enablement toward capacity planning, commissioning timelines, and power certainty.

## Key Findings

- India’s AI infrastructure market is entering a **capacity-led growth phase**, where realized outcomes depend more on infrastructure deployment speed than on underlying demand growth.  
- The AI-hostable cloud infrastructure segment, comprising Infrastructure-as-a-Service and Platform-as-a-Service, is projected to expand from approximately **US$4.7 billion today to around US$13.0 billion by FY30**, driven by enterprise AI adoption and cloud-native machine learning platforms.  
- India’s operational third-party data center capacity, estimated at approximately **1.25 gigawatts**, is expected to reach **2.4–2.5 gigawatts by FY28**, with total installed capacity approaching **4.3–4.5 gigawatts by FY30**.  
- The data center expansion pipeline corresponds to a multi-year capital investment opportunity estimated at **US$27.7–30.1 billion**, with approximately **US$10.8 billion deployed during the FY26–FY28 period**.  
- Power availability, cooling capability, and time-to-commission have emerged as the most binding constraints for AI-ready infrastructure deployment across major Indian hubs.

## Market Overview  

The **India AI infrastructure market outlook** points to sustained expansion through FY30, but with growth increasingly governed by physical and operational constraints rather than demand creation alone. AI workloads differ materially from traditional enterprise IT in their requirements, placing disproportionate pressure on power density, cooling efficiency, and interconnection ecosystems.

- Public cloud services market size: approximately **US$13.3 billion**, with Infrastructure-as-a-Service and Platform-as-a-Service accounting for **34–35 percent**  
- Projected public cloud services market by FY30: approximately **US$37.0 billion**  
- AI-hostable Infrastructure-as-a-Service and Platform-as-a-Service by FY30: approximately **US$13.0 billion**  

In parallel, India’s data center sector is undergoing a sustained build-out to support AI-ready environments. This expansion is highly capital intensive and geographically concentrated, reinforcing the importance of site selection, power access, and network connectivity in infrastructure planning.

Mumbai currently accounts for approximately **53–54 percent of total operational data center capacity**, positioning it as India’s primary interconnection and cloud infrastructure hub. While secondary markets such as Chennai, Hyderabad, Delhi–NCR, and Bengaluru continue to attract incremental investment, future growth is expected to increasingly favor power-advantaged regions, supported by high-capacity network backhaul to core hubs.

“India’s AI infrastructure market is not constrained by lack of demand,” said **[Alora Advisory](/contact)**. “The defining challenge through 2030 will be how quickly power, data center capacity, and cloud infrastructure can be planned, commissioned, and scaled to support AI workloads in production.”

For enterprise buyers, cloud providers, investors, and policymakers, the outlook underscores a shift in value creation. Speed and certainty of capacity delivery, rather than pricing alone, are becoming the primary competitive differentiators. Infrastructure decisions made during this period will have lasting implications for cost structures, ecosystem positioning, and India’s ability to support large-scale AI deployment.
