## Introduction

A new **Alora Advisory** case study highlights how an independent brand perception study can strengthen positioning in India’s fast-growing **home healthcare devices market**. As adoption expands across categories such as blood pressure monitors, glucometers, oximeters, weighing scales, and nebulizers, competition has intensified and leadership narratives are increasingly difficult to substantiate without third-party evidence.

In credibility-driven healthcare categories, trust is not a marketing attribute. It is a purchase determinant. Consumers evaluate home healthcare device brands on perceived accuracy, reliability, availability, and confidence in clinical recommendations. In this environment, brands that rely on unvalidated leadership claims face higher reputational risk and weaker differentiation.

To address this, a leading consumer medical devices brand commissioned Alora Advisory to conduct a national brand awareness and perception program to objectively assess market standing, trust metrics, and competitive positioning.

## Key Findings

- **Trust and accuracy ranked above price sensitivity** as decision drivers, reflecting the credence-based nature of home healthcare devices.  
- **Doctor recommendations and healthcare professional guidance** were among the strongest purchase influences, reinforcing the importance of clinical credibility.  
- **E-commerce channels and brand websites** accounted for the majority of purchases, with pharmacies remaining important for first-time buyers and offline reassurance.  
- **Brand switching was common** when consumers perceived a clear improvement in quality, performance, or features, indicating loyalty is earned through evidence rather than habit.  
- **Recommendation intent (NPS) correlated strongly with perceived reliability**, with higher-trust brands generating greater advocacy.

## Methodology

The engagement was executed as a structured, national brand perception study focused on India’s home healthcare devices category set.

- **Sample size:** 10,000 respondents

## Why This Matters

This case reflects a broader shift in consumer healthcare and medical devices: **brand leadership claims increasingly require data-backed validation**. As regulation, consumer awareness, and digital review ecosystems mature, perception research is becoming a strategic input for senior leadership rather than a downstream marketing activity.

For companies operating in trust-sensitive markets, independent perception data can reduce strategic risk by aligning internal narratives to external evidence, clarifying competitive differentiation, and strengthening long-term category leadership.
