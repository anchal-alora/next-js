## Introduction

A new **Global Hospital-at-Home Technology Market Outlook to 2030** indicates that Hospital-at-Home models are moving beyond pilot programs and into more structured healthcare delivery pathways. What began as a targeted approach to manage selected patient cohorts outside inpatient settings is increasingly becoming a scalable alternative for acute and post-acute care, supported by advances in remote patient monitoring, virtual care platforms, and clinical decision support systems.

The timing of this outlook is notable. Healthcare systems across regions continue to face sustained capacity constraints, workforce shortages, and rising demand linked to chronic disease prevalence and aging populations. Against this backdrop, Hospital-at-Home technology is being evaluated not only for cost optimization, but also for its ability to extend clinical capacity while maintaining hospital-grade oversight.
