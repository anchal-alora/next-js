## Executive Summary

The Global Hospital-at-Home (HaH) Technology Market is evolving as healthcare systems explore alternatives to facility-based acute and post-acute care delivery. Hospital-at-Home models use a combination of remote patient monitoring, virtual care platforms, clinical decision support systems, and home-based logistics to deliver hospital-level care in residential settings.

As of 2024, the global Hospital-at-Home technology market is estimated at **US$38.0–42.0 billion**. Market expansion is supported by increasing healthcare capacity constraints, demographic shifts toward aging populations, and the growing integration of digital health infrastructure into mainstream care delivery. Between 2025 and 2030, the market is projected to grow at a compound annual growth rate of approximately **18–20 percent**, reaching an estimated **US$95.0–105.0 billion by 2030**.

North America currently accounts for the largest share of market revenue due to established reimbursement mechanisms and higher digital health adoption. Europe represents a structurally stable market supported by public health systems, while Asia-Pacific is expected to record the fastest growth due to healthcare digitization, urban population density, and hospital infrastructure limitations.
