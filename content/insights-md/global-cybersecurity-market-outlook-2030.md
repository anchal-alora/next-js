## Executive Summary

The global cybersecurity market has transitioned from a reactive information technology function into a strategic priority across enterprises, governments, and critical infrastructure operators. This shift is being driven by the rising scale and sophistication of cyber threats, the expansion of digital attack surfaces, and the convergence of information technology and operational technology environments. As organizations accelerate cloud adoption, remote work, artificial intelligence deployment, and data-driven business models, cybersecurity has become central to operational continuity, regulatory compliance, and enterprise risk management.

In 2024, the global cybersecurity market is estimated at **US$215.0–225.0 billion**, reflecting sustained double-digit expansion over the past five years. Between 2019 and 2024, the market grew at a compound annual growth rate of approximately **11.5 percent**, supported by rising enterprise security budgets, increasing regulatory scrutiny, and the growing financial impact of cyber incidents. Looking ahead, the market is projected to reach **US$430.0–460.0 billion by 2030**, expanding at a compound annual growth rate of **12–13 percent** during the 2025–2030 forecast period.

Market growth is increasingly shaped by a structural shift away from fragmented, point-based security tools toward integrated platforms covering cloud security, identity and access management, zero-trust architectures, and artificial intelligence–enabled threat detection. While large enterprises continue to account for the majority of cybersecurity spending, small and mid-sized organizations represent a key growth segment due to rising compliance exposure and increased adoption of managed security services.

## Market Overview

### Context and Genesis of the Market

Cybersecurity originated as a subset of network protection focused on perimeter defense and antivirus solutions. Over the past two decades, the market has expanded in response to internet penetration, enterprise digitalization, cloud computing adoption, and the emergence of organized cybercrime. Today, cybersecurity encompasses a broad range of software, hardware, and services designed to secure data, systems, applications, networks, and digital identities across hybrid and multi-cloud environments.

### Key Market Drivers

- Escalating cyber threats including ransomware, supply-chain attacks, zero-day vulnerabilities, and state-sponsored cyber activity  
- Technological evolution driven by cloud computing, Internet of Things deployments, fifth-generation networks, and artificial intelligence  
- Policy and regulatory pressure stemming from data protection regulations and critical infrastructure mandates  
- Workforce and operating model changes accelerating identity-centric and zero-trust security adoption  

### Impact of Macroeconomic and Environmental Factors

Cybersecurity spending has demonstrated resilience relative to broader information technology budgets during periods of macroeconomic uncertainty. Cyber risk is increasingly treated as a material operational and financial risk rather than a discretionary technology expense. Geopolitical tensions, supply-chain disruptions, and climate-related events have further reinforced the importance of cyber resilience.
