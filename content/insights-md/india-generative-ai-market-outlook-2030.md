## Executive Summary

The India Generative AI market is progressing from early-stage experimentation toward broader enterprise and public-sector adoption. During the 2023–2024 period, Generative AI deployments in India expanded beyond isolated pilots, supported by improvements in foundation model performance, gradual reductions in inference costs, expanding cloud infrastructure availability, and increased institutional clarity around digital public infrastructure frameworks.

India’s role as a global IT services hub, combined with a large digital-native user base, an active startup ecosystem, and national digital platforms such as Aadhaar, UPI, and ONDC, has created structural conditions supportive of Generative AI adoption. At the same time, market development remains influenced by constraints related to data quality, access to compute infrastructure, concentration of advanced AI talent, and the evolving regulatory environment.

As of 2024, the India Generative AI market is estimated to be valued in the low-to-mid single-digit US$ billions. Over the medium term, the market is expected to expand at a high double-digit compound annual growth rate through 2030, driven primarily by enterprise use cases, vertical-specific applications, and AI-enabled service exports.

## Market Overview

### Context and Genesis of the Market

Generative AI adoption in India initially emerged through exposure to global large language models and developer platforms between 2020 and 2022. Early usage was largely confined to IT services firms, digital-native enterprises, and multinational research and development centers operating within India.

A more pronounced shift occurred during 2023, as improvements in model reliability and commercial usability enabled enterprises to move from experimental deployments toward structured pilots and limited-scale implementation. The market’s evolution has been shaped by three interrelated factors: rising enterprise demand for productivity and automation, platform availability through cloud and open-source ecosystems, and growing emphasis on localization, including multilingual capability and domain-specific model tuning.

### Key Market Drivers

Key factors supporting market growth include enterprise demand for productivity improvement across IT services and financial services, talent augmentation requirements in knowledge-intensive functions, ongoing public-sector digitalization initiatives, and continued improvements in model performance relative to cost. Demand for India-specific language and contextual capability has further contributed to the development of localized Generative AI solutions.

### Macroeconomic and Environmental Considerations

India’s broader economic growth outlook and sustained digital investment trends support medium-term Generative AI adoption. However, market expansion remains sensitive to global technology spending cycles, currency movements, and infrastructure constraints. Energy availability and power costs associated with data center expansion are emerging as longer-term considerations for compute-intensive AI workloads.

## Market Size and Growth Outlook

The India Generative AI market is estimated to be valued at approximately US$3.0–5.0 billion in 2024, including spending on software platforms, model access, integration services, and enterprise deployments.

Between 2019 and 2024, the market recorded growth exceeding thirty percent annually from a relatively small base, reflecting increased AI platform adoption and cloud migration. Over the 2025–2030 forecast period, the market is expected to grow at an estimated compound annual growth rate of approximately thirty-five–forty-five percent, potentially reaching US$25.0–35.0 billion by 2030. Growth projections are based on assumptions related to enterprise adoption rates, service export expansion, infrastructure investment, and regulatory continuity.
